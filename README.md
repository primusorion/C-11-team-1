# Task Management System

This project is a simple implementation of a task management system. It allows users to add, view, and manage their tasks efficiently. The system is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a user-friendly interface and smooth interaction.

## Features

- **Task Addition**: Users can add tasks using the "+ Create Task" button located at the top corner of the task box. This feature is implemented with JavaScript, dynamically updating the task list.
- **Styling**: The application is styled with CSS, providing a modern and clean user interface. Special attention is given to the task addition button and the calendar navigation buttons (`prevMonth` and `nextMonth`), with custom colors and hover effects.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience across all devices.

## How to Use

1. **Adding a Task**: Click on the "+ Create Task" button, enter your task in the input field that appears, and press Enter. The task will be added to your list.
2. **Navigating Through Months**: Use the `prevMonth` and `nextMonth` buttons to navigate through the calendar and manage tasks for different dates.
